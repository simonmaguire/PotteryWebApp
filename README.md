# Pottery Web App (Kiln Yard?)

A Web Application for tacking notes on pottery projects. Created using the MERN stack with TypeScript, Rest APIs and tested with Jest.
Key frameworks also include: react-hook-form, react-bootstrap and Yup

Currently all that is "completed" is a barebones list page for all the different pots and a form page for creating and updating pots. 

This project was started as a way to learn the MERN stack as well as TypeScript. Though I also would like to start using an app for tracking my pottery projects so who knows I may take this all the way to launch.
But key things that will be done soon are touching up the look of the UI, allowing the upload of pictures and multiple users.
